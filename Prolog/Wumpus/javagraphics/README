To run the graphical wumpus, make sure you have everything from the
javagraphics folder and that you are logged in on discovery (that's the only
host that will work).

Step 1: Export java library path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/java/jdk1.6.0_24/jre/lib/i386:/usr/local/java/jdk1.6.0_24/jre/lib/i386/client

Step 2: Run Prolog
   consult(swi_wumpus).
   
Step 3: Execute the statment: 
   start_gui.

After you're in, you will have a place to specify the relative path to your
agent file and the number of trials.  Then click on the cave tab to watch.

Note that this is imperfect code from a student project and does sometimes
crash.
