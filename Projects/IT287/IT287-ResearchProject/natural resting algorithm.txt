Find the model's center of gravity -> g
Project g onto plane where y=lowest slice.y -> g'
while(g' not contained in lowest slice)
{
    find vertex on lowest slice closest to g' -> v1
    find ray between v1 and g' -> ray1
    find perpendicular line to ray1 through v1 -> perp1
    For(all vertices in the model)
    {
        v2 = a vertex in the model
        if(v2 is on the same side of perp1 as g')
        {
            compute ray2 where ray2 is perpendicular with perp1 and ray2 pass through v2 and
              perp1
            compuate angle1 = angle between ray2 and ray1
            if this angle is smaller than the angle found for any other vertex, record this angle
              as AngleMin and save v2
        }
    }
    Rotate the entire model on the axis perp1 by angle AngleMin
    Recalculate the slices
    recalculate center of gravity -> g
    g' = g projected onto the lowest slice
